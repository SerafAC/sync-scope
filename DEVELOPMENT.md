# Developing SyncScope

This guide is for people working on the SyncScope code. For what the app does and how it is built, see
[docs/](./docs/README.md).

## Environment gotchas

Known environment and tooling pitfalls, each traced to the project memory it came from (MEM-IDs) or to the
task that found it.

### Android SDK location and JDK for JVM tests (MEM015)

Android JVM unit tests (`pnpm test:android:unit`) need three local prerequisites:

- **An Android SDK that Gradle can find**, through `ANDROID_HOME` or `sdk.dir` in `android/local.properties`
  (git-ignored). A root-owned system SDK with only build-tools is not enough; point Gradle at a user SDK
  such as `~/Android/Sdk`.
- **A JDK 21+ test launcher.** Robolectric refuses to sandbox SDK 36 on Java 17. The Gradle toolchain in
  `android/app/build.gradle` requests Java 21.
- **The Robolectric SDK 36 runtime jar** (`android-all-instrumented-16-robolectric-13921718-i7`) in the
  pinned Robolectric cache. The build reads that cache from `ROBOLECTRIC_REPO_URL` and
  `ROBOLECTRIC_DEPENDENCY_DIR` when set, and from a local toolchain cache otherwise; a cache that only has
  the SDK 23 artifact fails.

### Robolectric pins `android.app.Application` (MEM016)

Robolectric boots the manifest's `MainApplication`, whose `ReactNativeApplicationEntryPoint` calls
`SoLoader` and throws a `NullPointerException` off-device. `android/app/src/test/resources/robolectric.properties`
therefore sets `application=android.app.Application`, so JVM tests never touch native loading. Keep it.

Related: in main source that unit tests reach, use `java.util.Base64`, not `android.util.Base64`; the latter
is an unmocked stub under JVM tests.

### Install dependencies and export `ANDROID_HOME` before Gradle (MEM017)

A fresh checkout, or one that lost its git-ignored setup, needs two things before any Gradle run:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # node_modules must be a real directory, not a symlink
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
```

`node_modules` must not be a symlink, because `.gitignore` uses `node_modules/`, which does not match a
symlink. Unit tests also need JDK 21 through the Gradle toolchain (see MEM015 above).

### Headless emulator and stale validator state (MEM021)

- **The API 31 validator emulator must run with `-no-window`.** Agent and CI sessions have no `DISPLAY`;
  without the flag, Qt's xcb platform plugin fails fatally ("no Qt platform plugin could be initialized")
  and `android-validator.sh` reports only "Emulator or validator lock failed to start."
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` gets further but still core-dumps. `scripts/validation/android-validator.sh`
  passes `-no-window`.
- **Clear stale state after an interrupted run.** `android-validator.sh start` aborts if
  `/tmp/cloud-sync-checker-api31` survives an interrupted run, or if any emulator is still attached to
  `adb`. Remove that directory and stop any attached emulator before retrying.

### Known issues from the S01 live gate (M001/S01/T08)

- **`-no-window` is unconditional.** The validator emulator never shows a window, even on a workstation with
  a display attached. That is the right default for a validation harness; to watch a run visually, remove
  the flag locally.
- **API 36 coverage is deferred.** The live connect gate has only run on API 31
  (`pnpm validation:android:api31`). API 36 coverage belongs to the integration closure of feature 008
  (`specs/008-full-loop-release`).
